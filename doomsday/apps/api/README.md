# Doomsday 2 Public API

This folder contains header files for the Doomsday Client and Server
executables' public APIs: all the functionality made available by the
executables at runtime. Plugins need to use these APIs for registering hooks
and accessing the engine's runtime functionality.

**NOTE:** This is all deprecated and will be removed in Doomsday 3.
Equivalent functionality is available via GameKit and DS.
