# Plugins

This folder contains plugin libraries that provide specific 
functionality, so of which is mutually exclusive with other
plugins (e.g., only one game is loaded at a time).

**NOTE:** This is all deprecated and will be removed in Doomsday 3.
Audio is moved to the Gui library, resource importers are moved 
to the Doomsday library, and games are replaced with GameKit.
