/**
 * World renderer used in Doomsday up until version 2.
 *
 * The classic world renderer uses the GPU mostly for rasterization. World
 * surfaces are accurately culled based on visibility. DGL is used as the
 * drawing API: it is limited to two textures at once, but batches multiple
 * primitives to larger draw calls.
 *
 * The classic world renderer sorts the visible surfaces based on textures,
 * so that many primitives can be drawn at once.
