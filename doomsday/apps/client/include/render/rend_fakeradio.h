/** @file rend_fakeradio.h  Geometry generation for faked, radiosity lighting.
 *
 * Perhaps the most distinctive characteristic of radiosity lighting is that
 * the corners of a room are slightly dimmer than the rest of the surfaces.
 * (It's not the only characteristic, however.)  We will fake these shadowed
 * areas by generating shadow polygons for wall segments and determining which
 * BSP leaf vertices will be shadowed.
 *
 * In other words, walls use shadow polygons (over entire lines), while planes
 * use vertex lighting. As sectors are usually partitioned into a great many
 * BSP leafs (and tesselated into triangles), they are better suited for vertex
 * lighting. In some cases we will be forced to split a BSP leaf into smaller
 * pieces than strictly necessary in order to achieve better accuracy in the
 * shadow effect.
