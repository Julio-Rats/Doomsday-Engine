 * (which may be scaled down for vanilla emulation) and renderer pixel density. I.e.,
 * the view border is outside this view texture.
 *
 * Lens FX are rendered inside the player view framebuffer after 3D rendering has been
 * completed and the color and depth textures are available.
 *
 * The finished game view texture is kept around until the next frame begins. It can be
 * copied for savegames, etc. at any time.
 *
 * After Lens FX, the contents of the framebuffer are ready for compositing with
 * additional layers, such as the view border and game HUD. These are drawn into the
 * current framebuffer.
