/**
 * @page mainFlow Engine Control Flow
 *
 * The main Qt application instance is ClientApp, based on de::BaseGuiApp.
 *
 * The event loop is started after the application has been initialized. Initialization
 * comprises the creation of subsystems and the main window. As a final step during
 * initialization, the "bootstrap" script is executed. At this point, the main window is
 * not visible yet. After the window appears with a fully functional OpenGL drawing
 * surface, the rest of the engine initialization is completed. This is done via an
 * observer audience in the de::GLWindow class.
 *
 * The application's refresh loop is controlled by de::Loop. Before each frame, clock
 * time advances and de::Loop's iteration audience is notified. This is observed by
 * de::WindowSystem, which updates all widgets. When the GameWidget is updated, it runs
 * game tics and requests a redraw of the window contents.
 *
 * During startup the engine goes through a series of busy mode tasks. While a busy task
 * is running, the application's primary event loop is blocked. However, BusyTask starts
 * another loop that continues handling events received by the application.
