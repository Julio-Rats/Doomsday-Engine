 * Event loop.

 * When an event loop is running, it puts the thread to sleep until an event is posted. After
 * waking up, it calls the virtual EventLoop::processEvent() method that notifies the Event
 * audience about the received event.
 *
 * Events can be posted from any thread, but event processing and notifications only occur on the
 * thread where the event loop is running.
 *
 * The event loop can be stopped by posting a Quit event. This can be conveniently done with
 * the EventLoop::quit() method. The exit code in the event is returned to the caller of
 * EventLoop::exec().
