/**
 * Executes an asynchronous callback in a background thread.
 *
 * After the background thread finishes, the result from the callback is passed to
 * another callback that is called in the main thread.
 *
 * Must be called from the main thread.
 *
 * If it is possible that the completion becomes invalid (e.g., the object that
 * started the operation is destroyed), you should use AsyncScope to automatically
 * invalidate the completion callbacks of the started tasks.
 *
 * @param task        Task callback. If an exception is thrown here, it will be
 *                    quietly caught, and the completion callback will be called with
 *                    a default-constructed result value. Note that if you return a
 *                    pointer to an object and intend to pass ownership to the
 *                    completion callback, the object will leak if the completion has
 *                    been invalidated. Therefore, you should always pass ownership via
 *                    std::shared_ptr or other reference-counted type.
 *
 * @param completion  Completion callback to be called in the main thread. Takes one
 *                    argument matching the type of the return value from @a task.
 *
 * @return Background thread object. The thread will delete itself after the completion
 * callback has been called. You can pass this to AsyncScope for keeping track of.
