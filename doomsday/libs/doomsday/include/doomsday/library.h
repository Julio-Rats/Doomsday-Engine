/** @file library.h  Dynamic libraries.
 * @ingroup base
 *
 * These functions provide roughly the same functionality as the ltdl library.
 * Since the ltdl library appears to be broken on macOS, these will be used
 * instead when loading plugin libraries.
 *
 * During startup Doomsday loads multiple game plugins. However, only one can
 * exist in memory at a time because they contain many of the same globally
 * visible symbols. When a game is started, all game plugins are first released
 * from memory after which the chosen game plugin is reloaded (see
 * Library_ReleaseGames()).
