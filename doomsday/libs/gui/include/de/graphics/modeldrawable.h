/**
 * Drawable that is constructed out of a 3D model file and texture map images.
 *
 * 3D model data is loaded using the Open Asset Import Library that supports
 * multiple different source formats.
 *
 * Lifetime.
 *
 * @par Animation
 *
 * ModelDrawable supports skeletal animation sequences.
 *
 * The nested class ModelDrawable::Animator is responsible for keeping track of
 * a model's animation state. When drawing an animated model, in addition to
 * having a ModelDrawable instance, one needs to create a
 * ModelDrawable::Animator and pass it to the draw() method.
 *
 * @par Textures and materials
 *
 * The model is composed of one or more meshes. Each mesh has a set of texture
 * maps associated with it (e.g., diffuse, normals, etc.). A set of texture
 * maps for all meshes is called a "material". ModelDrawable may have multiple
 * materials, but only one of them is active for drawing at a time. Only one
 * copy of each texture image is stored in the atlas even though multiple
 * materials use it.
 *
 * Internally, each material corresponds to a separate static vertex buffer.
 * The vertex coordinates in each buffer are prepared with the textures'
 * locations on the atlas. The active material can thus be switched at any time
 * during drawing, e.g., between rendering passes, without incurring a
 * performance penalty.
 *
 * @todo Refactor: Split the non-Assimp specific parts into a MeshDrawable base
 * class, so it can be used with meshes generated procedurally (e.g., the map),
 * taking advantage of the rendering pass and instancing features.
 *
