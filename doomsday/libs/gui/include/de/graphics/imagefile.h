/**
 * Image file. @ingroup fs
 *
 * Represents images in the file system and allows performing image filtering
 * via special file names.
 *
 * An image processing filter can be applied using a subfolder notation:
 *
 * <pre>example.png/HeightMap.toNormals</pre>
 *
 * The name of the filter is added to the path as if the image was a folder.
 * (It isn't actually a folder.) Internally, the filtered images are separate
 * ImageFile objects owned by the original ImageFile. This means they get
 * deleted if the original is deleted, and they can only be accessed via the
 * subfolder notation -- only the original image resides in the parent folder.
