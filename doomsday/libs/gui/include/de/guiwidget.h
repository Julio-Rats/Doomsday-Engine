/**
 * Base class for graphical widgets.
 *
 * Each GuiWidget has one RuleRectangle that defines the widget's position in
 * the view. However, all widgets are allowed to draw outside this rectangle
 * and react to events occurring outside it. In essence, all widgets thus cover
 * the entire view area and can be thought as a (hierarchical) stack.
 *
 * GuiWidget is the base class for all widgets of a GUI application. However, a
 * GuiWidget does not necessarily need to have a visible portion on the screen:
 * its entire purpose may be to handle events, for example.
 *
 * The common features GuiWidget offers to all widgets are:
 *
 * - Automatically saving and restoring persistent state. Classes that implement
 *   IPersistent will automatically be saved and restored when the widget is
 *   (de)initialized.
 *
 * - Background geometry builder. All widgets may use this to build geometry for
 *   the background of the widget. However, widgets are also allowed to fully
 *   generate all of their geometry from scratch.
 *
 * - Access to the UI Style.
 *
 * - GuiWidget can be told which font and text color to use using a style
 *   definition identifier (e.g., "editor.hint"). These style elements are then
 *   conveniently accessible using methods of GuiWidget.
 *
 * - Opacity property. Opacities respect the hierarchical organization of
 *   widgets: GuiWidget::visibleOpacity() returns the opacity of a particular
 *   widget where all the parent widgets' opacities are factored in.
 *
 * - Hit testing: checking if a view space point should be considered to be
 *   inside the widget. The default implementation simply checks if the point is
 *   inside the widget's rectangle. Derived classes may override this to adapt
 *   hit testing to their particular visual shape.
 *
 * - Logic for handling more complicated interactions such as a mouse pointer
 *   click (press then release inside or outside), and passing received events
 *   to separately registered event handler objects.
 *
 * QObject is a base class for the signals and slots capabilities.
 *
 * @note Always use GuiWidget::destroy() to delete any GUI widget. It will
 * ensure that the widget is properly deinitialized before destruction.
