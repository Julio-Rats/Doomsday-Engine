/**
 * Widget layout for a row-based left-to-right sequence of widgets.
 *
 * Layouts are utilities that modify the placement of widgets. The layout
 * instance itself does not need to remain in memory -- widget rules are
 * modified immediately as the widgets are added to the layout.
 *
 * Widgets will reflow to the next row if they don't fit on the current
 * row. The row length must be provided as a separate independent rule.
 *
 * @note Because each position depends on the preceding ones and has the
 * option to either continue the row or break out to a new one, this creates
 * a lot of interdependent, branching rules. It is adviced that FlowLayout
 * is only used for a relatively small number of widgets in a sequence.
