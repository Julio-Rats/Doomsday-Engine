/**
 * @file de/reader.h
 * Deserializer for reading values and data from a byte array.
 *
 * Reader1 instances assume that all values stored in the source array are in
 * little-endian (Intel) byte order. All read operations are checked against
 * the buffer boundaries; reading too much data from the buffer results in an
 * error.
 *
 * If @c DENG_WRITER_TYPECHECK is defined, the type check codes preceding
 * the data values are checked for validity. The assumption is that the source
 * data buffer has been created using a Writer1.
 *
 * @see writer.h, Writer1
 *
 * @todo  This should be converted into a C wrapper for de::Reader.
